# Secret Santa

This program assigns secret santas and emails everyone who they have.  Each person has a "noSanta" list of people whom they can't be secret santa for. For example, you might not want to allow spouses to have each other for secret santa.

For more info about sending emails with python, see http://naelshiab.com/tutorial-send-email-python/. Also note that gmail requires you to create an application specific password for authentication. See your google security settings for more information.

For now, you have to go back to the outbox for last year to update the "lastYear" field for each member of the family. There is a TODO to automatically update the json for next year.
